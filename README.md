## DRAFT STAGE

### Purpose:

- Full-stack app that allows users to find their location and find the price of the nearest house.
- Users can save their favorite houses

## IDEA:
- look at REAL ESTATE Sites for CSS ideas/inspiration
- add Directions from INPUT, output Est Commute/Driving Time (ex. to work)/draw route
  https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/mapbox-gl-directions/
  https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/directions/
- add setTimeOut / only one Activation Button (one fetch after the other)
  https://alligator.io/js/settimeout-setinterval/
- live route https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/live-update-feature/
- add a marker/point https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/drag-a-marker/

## TO DO:

- change Database in database.js
- add CRUD...first, "Save House" BUTTON -
  - non-compliant:  save $$ and address in a ul
  - compliant: save coordinates and rawAddress and inputs for Zillow api
    (streetAddress, city, state)
- add CSS/background image
- add Media Queries and REMs
- add link to Zillow house's page
- add BUTTONS for preset addresses (demo day)

- add INPUT where you can input address to check price ZestimateAmt
- Restyle the Mapbox Logo Bar.
  Change the default position for attribution
  https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/attribution-position/
- check price by using mouse to get latitude and longitude coordinates
  https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/mouse-position/
- SCROLL THOUGH FAVORITES and FLY w/ MAP
  Fly to a location based on scroll position
  https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/scroll-fly-to/
- add Navigation functionality (possible?)
- for Demo Day: add "Live Preview Trip"/"Simulation Trip"

## Bugs to Review:
- If can't save Zestimate, save Coordinates as Favorites and show Zestimate onclick of "Get Property Price" Button
- "Get Property Price" Button" should FLY to selected coordinates and not only zoom
  - create f(x) zoom and f(x) fly and if...then statement for were Zillow fetch is called from ( if from FAV List, then FLY, else ZOOM)

- Reverse Geocoding may return "name" of place in addition to street address, interfering with naming system.
- rawAddress: Emerson College Journalism, 120 Boylston St, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, United States
  streetAddress: Emerson College Journalism
  city: 120 Boylston St
  state: Boston
